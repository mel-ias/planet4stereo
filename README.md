# planetstereo

Planet4Stereo was developed to provide a fully open access SFM-MVS pipeline to generate 3D digital elevation models (DEM) from multi-temporal Planetscope imagery. 
Planetscope images are monoscopic and thus, do not provide in-house options for photogrammetric 3D stereo reconstruction. However, with more than 200 active nano satellites operating in very close sun-synchronous orbits, 
there are numerous quasi-stereo image pairs which, although not optimal in terms of their image section geometry, still offer the possibility of generating precise 3D surface models due to their high redundancy. 
The toolchain includes, among others, routines for stereo pair preselection based on metrics like minimum convergence angles and overlap given in the literature, bundle block adjustment, stereo reconstruction and DEM rasterization. The latter are provided by the open source toolbox [AMES Stereo Pipeline](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## Purpose
The pipeline provided is intended to enable geoscientists to generate high-resolution surface models with resolutions of a few meters and thus offers an interesting alternative to commercial systems. Options for assessing the accuracy of the calculated DEMs based on reference DEMs are also integrated. 


## Getting started // Installation // Dependencies

The entire pipeline is implemented in Python. It requires some common Python libraries for process handling and geo data processing as well as the AMES Stereo Pipeline (ASP) toolbox, version 3.3.0. 
We advice to use a conda environment to manage the necessary python libraries, which should be set up as follows:

1. create a new conda environment 'planet4stereo' using python 3.9
```
conda create --name planet4stereo python=3.9
conda activate planet4stereo
```

2. install packages for geo data processing. Note, the order of installation is important and should not be changed to avoid conflicts
```
conda install gdal
conda install geopandas #includes pandas package + shapely package
conda install geojson
conda install rasterio
```

3. install packages for process handling (information on some packages: p-tqdm: task scheduling / parallelization; ipykernel: required to run jupyter notebook)
```
conda install psutil
conda install progressbar 
conda install p-tqdm 
conda install ipykernel 
```

4. download and install ASP version 3.3.0 (stable) from the official github repo and follow the installation instructions for your OS
- link to official github repo: https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/releases 
- follow the install instructions: https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installation 
- Note, do not forget to set a permanent path to the binaries via ```export PATH=${PATH}:/path/to/StereoPipeline/bin"```


## Usage
To use the pipeline, simply call planet4stereo.py with the required parameters. Use [-h] for help. 

which are separated into user, expert and debug settings, 
- User settings are mandatory and define, e.g., the paths to the planetscope scenes (PSS), the reference DEM or the working directory. 
- Expert settings are used to adjust the data constraints when running stereo reconstruction, e.g., the minimum required convergence angle of an image pair and overlap or the image band to be used for stereo reconstruction. 
- Debug settings are used to switch off individual process steps for debugging reasons. Expert and debug settings do not necessarily have to be adjusted.

Planet4Stereo: a small ASP-based pipeline to generate medium-resolution DEMs from multi-temporal Planetscope data

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dem_res DEM_RES     set output GSD of the DEM (in meters), default: dem_res: None, i.e. the median GSD of the input images is used for dem_gsd (default: None)
  --pss_band PSS_BAND   ASP works with 1ch/3ch images. Recommended to use 1ch NIR (B4) for most contrast in saturated areas, e.g. snow-covered areas (default: 4)
  --ortho ORTHO         orthorectify input images using reference DEM (may improve correlation in stereo matching) (default: True)
  --elevation_tolerance_from_dem ELEVATION_TOLERANCE_FROM_DEM
                        calculate elevation limit range from reference DEM (max/min DEM heights +/- tolerance value) to get rid of coarse outlier (default: 500.0)
  --min_convergence_angle MIN_CONVERGENCE_ANGLE
                        minimum convergence angle between two PSS images (measured from PSS centers). Values higher than 0Â° are recommened for scene preselection (see by Huang et al., 2022) (default: 4.0)
